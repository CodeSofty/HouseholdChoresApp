# HouseholdChoresApp
This is a simple household chore assignment app

I've used an array of objects with 2 keys each: 'name' and 'what'.
Then I randomly selected a name from one of the values for 'name' (Steve or Susan), and a value from 'what' (a chore). 
The selected values are then sent to the document.
